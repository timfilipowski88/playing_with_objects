Playing with Objects
Imagine that you are given an array of objects.  For example,

var users = [{name: "Michael", age:37}, {name: "John", age:30}, {name: "David", age:27}];
How would you print/log John's age?
How would you print/log the name of the first object?
How would you print/log the name and age of each user using a for loop?  Your output should look something like this
Michael - 37
John - 30
David - 27
